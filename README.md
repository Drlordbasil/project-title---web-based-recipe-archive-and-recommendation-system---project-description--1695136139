# Web-based Recipe Archive and Recommendation System

The "Web-based Recipe Archive and Recommendation System" is a Python program designed to automate various tasks related to recipe management and recommendation. The program utilizes web scraping techniques, natural language processing algorithms, and user input to provide a comprehensive recipe archive and personalized recipe recommendations based on user preferences.

## Features

### 1. Web Scraping
The program utilizes the Beautiful Soup library to scrape recipe data from popular cooking websites such as Allrecipes, Food Network, and Epicurious. It extracts information such as ingredients, cooking instructions, prep time, and ratings from these websites.

### 2. Recipe Archive Creation
The scraped recipe data is organized into a user-friendly interface, creating a centralized recipe archive. Users can browse through different categories, search for specific recipes, and sort recipes by various criteria such as dietary preferences, difficulty level, or cuisine type.

### 3. Personalized Recipe Recommendations
The program applies natural language processing algorithms to analyze user preferences. Users can provide input on their dietary restrictions, preferred ingredients, cooking styles, or allergies. Based on this input, the program generates personalized recipe recommendations tailored to the user's preferences.

### 4. Ingredient Substitution Suggestions
The program utilizes NLP and web scraping techniques to suggest ingredient substitutions for specific dietary restrictions or allergies. For example, if a user is allergic to dairy, the program can recommend suitable alternatives for milk or cheese in a recipe.

### 5. Meal Planning and Grocery List Generation
The program allows users to plan their weekly meals by selecting recipes from the archive. It automatically generates a consolidated grocery list based on the selected recipes, eliminating the need for manual list creation.

### 6. Social Sharing and User Contributions
The program integrates with social media platforms to allow users to share their favorite recipes with friends. It also provides a feature for users to contribute their own recipes to the archive, expanding the collection.

### 7. Recipe Rating and Feedback
The program enables users to rate and provide feedback on the recipes they have tried. This information is used to refine the recommendation system and continuously improve the recipe archive.
