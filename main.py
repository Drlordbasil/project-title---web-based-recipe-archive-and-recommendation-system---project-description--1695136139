'''python 

To break down long functions or methods and modularize the code further, 
you need to split them into smaller, more focused functions or methods. 
This will make the code more organized, readable, and easier to maintain.

Regarding the "unterminated string literal" error, it seems like 
there is an issue with an unclosed string in your code. 
Please provide the specific code or the relevant portion of it, 
and I can help you resolve the error and modularize the code.
